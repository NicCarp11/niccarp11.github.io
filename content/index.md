about: "I am a PhD student in the [Systems Research Group](https://dse.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, under the supervision of [Prof. Pramod Bhatotia](https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/).  \nMy research focuses on **Computer Architecture and Systems**, particularly exploring **cache coherence protocols** for heterogeneous and disaggregated memory systems.

\n\nDuring my master's studies, I developed a strong interest in **hardware acceleration for deep learning applications**. My **master's thesis** focused on efficient mapping strategies for convolutional layers on **OpenEdgeCGRA**, an open-hardware, low-power CGRA platform.

\n\nI am passionate about **bridging the gap between hardware and software** in next-generation computing architectures. 

\n\nIf you're interested in collaborating or discussing my research, feel free to **[reach out to me](mailto:nicolo.carpentieri@tum.de)**."

## Bio  

I completed my *Master's degree in Computer Engineering* at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) from 2021 to 2024, specializing in *Embedded Systems*. I successfully defended my thesis in April 2024, which was conducted in collaboration with the [Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL)](https://esl.epfl.ch/) at EPFL and the [Department of Control and Computer Engineering (DAUIN)](https://www.dauin.polito.it/) at Politecnico di Torino.  

Prior to that, I earned my *Bachelor’s degree in Electronic Engineering* from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) between 2018 and 2021.  

I completed my secondary education at [Liceo Pietro Paolo Parzanese](https://www.liceoparzanese.edu.it/) in Ariano Irpino, where I obtained my *Scientific High School Diploma* in 2018.

# Besides Work or Research
----------------------------
I’m a naturally **curious person**, always eager to explore new ideas, dissect problems, and find solutions. One of my biggest passions outside of engineering is **medicine**—I grew up idolizing *Dr. House*, and I’ve always loved the mindset of diagnosing problems and figuring out solutions. This approach extends beyond my work; I apply it to everyday life, always searching for ways to understand and fix things.

To take a break from my daily routine, I turn to **sports**, both indoor and outdoor. I love **playing and watching sports**, and my interests range widely—from **skiing**, **tennis**, **football**, **basketball**, and **padel**, to **volleyball** (yes, I was an *hyperactive* kid).

Beyond sports, music has been a big part of my life. I played **piano** and **recorder** for over **eight years**.
