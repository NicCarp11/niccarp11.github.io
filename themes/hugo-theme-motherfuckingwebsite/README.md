## Hugo theme forked from [here](https://github.com/mpcsh/hugo-theme-motherfuckingwebsite).

Sample site: [github.com/Gingerbreadz/anatolelefort.net](https://github.com/Gingerbreadz/anatolelefort.net)

Live demo: [anatolelefort.net](https://anatolelefort.net)

Here is a short digest of local changes:

- “profile-type” landing page, instead of blog index.
- index page with sidebar (logo, title, social links and custom text blocks).
- table of contents (opt in/out) for articles (inline) or index page (inline or center navbar).
- tri-column navbar.
- user-defined partial head layouts (favicon.html, head\_includes.html).
- minor styling changes to personal taste.
- explicit 404 error message.

# I've archived this repository because I no longer use `hugo`.

At archive time, this repository has a few stars and at least one other user I know of. I suggest making a fork of this repository because I won't make any guarantees about it being available in the future.
